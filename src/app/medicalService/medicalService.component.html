          A medical course education loan is a type of financial assistance
          offered by banks or financial institutions to students who want to
          pursue undergraduate or postgraduate courses in the field of medicine.
          The loan is meant to cover the cost of tuition fees, books, equipment,
          and other related expenses incurred during the course of study. <br />

          The loan amount can vary depending on the course, the institution, and
          the duration of the program. Most lenders offer loans up to Rs. 20
          lakhs for undergraduate courses and up to Rs. 40 lakhs for
          postgraduate courses. The repayment period can also vary, ranging from
          5 to 15 years, depending on the loan amount and the lender's policies.

            <b> Interest Rates:</b> The interest rate on education loans can
            vary depending on the lender, but it is usually in the range of 8%
            to 15%. However, interest rates may be higher or lower depending on
            factors such as the borrower's credit history, loan amount, and
            repayment period.

            <br />
            <b>Repayment:</b>Most lenders allow borrowers to start repaying the
            loan six months to a year after the completion of the course or
            after the borrower starts earning. The repayment period can be up to
            15 years, depending on the lender and loan amount.
            <br />

            <b>Loan Limits: </b> The amount of money that students can borrow
            through medical course education loans is limited. Federal loans
            have annual and lifetime limits, while private loan limits may vary
