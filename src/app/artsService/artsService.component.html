          An arts and science education loan is a type of financial assistance
          provided to students who are pursuing a degree in the arts or
          sciences. These loans are typically offered by banks or financial
          institutions, and they can be used to cover the costs of tuition fees,
          books, living expenses, and other related educational expenses.
          <br />

          Arts and science education loans usually come with competitive
          interest rates and flexible repayment options, which can make it
          easier for students to finance their education. In some cases, these
          loans may also be accompanied by additional benefits, such as a grace
          period after graduation before repayment begins or the ability to
          defer payments if the borrower experiences financial hardship

            <b>Loan Amount:</b> Education loans can cover up to 100% of the
            total expenses of the course, including tuition fees, accommodation
            fees, exam fees, and other related expenses. The maximum loan amount
            may vary from lender to lender.

            <br />
            <b>Interest Rate: </b> Education loan interest rates may vary from
            8% to 15% depending on the lender, the loan amount, and the

            female students.
            <br />

            <b>Collateral and Guarantor: </b> Education loans above a certain
            amount may require collateral or a guarantor. The collateral may be
            in the form of property, fixed deposit, or any other assets. The
            guarantor may be a family member or any other person who is willing
            to take responsibility for the loan repayment if the borrower is
            unable to do so.
